  ##Credits: 
  
    Huge thanks to my tutor Mansi Patel for teaching me so many concepts with this assignment.  That includes professional best practices like creating separate files for each type of API route.  My understanding is that this follows the coding principle of separation of concerns.  Meaning that this code is more scalable than when I had all the routes in one file. In the likely case there is ever an error with a route, I will be able to search only the file that throws the error, instead of all of the code.
